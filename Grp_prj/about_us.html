        <h6>We understand urgency and the importance of flexibility. Our clients are offered a 24 hour call out
            facility, which operates 365 days a year with a maximum response time of 4 hours. Our highly experienced,
            directly employed technicians specialise in a broad range of mechanical and electrical disciplines,
            providing our clients with an excellent delivery partner for all their commercial installation, reactive
            maintenance and ongoing preventative maintenance requirements.</h6>

        <h6>Voltix Services uses industry-leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software that provides relevant
            data at the click of a button. This means that we are able to communicate effectively with our clients and
            resolve problems quickly. Having data easily accessible means that when a client raises any question or
            issue, we can get back to them immediately with the information to help them solve it. Many of our
            competitors lack this vital ability.​</h6>

    </div>


    <div class="details3">

        <h6>The CRM also helps us keep on top of maintenance work, with automatic triggers, data-logging and trend
            reporting ensuring that work is done proactively instead of reactively. With an in-house CRM developer,
            systems are fine-tuned and upgraded weekly.​</h6>
